## About
This project was created to explore and analyze agricultural data in a simple and clear way. The focus is on showing the differences between maize and coffee in terms of their market performance. By using data analysis, the project helps in understanding how these crops compare across different years.  

The work also aims to give farmers, students, and researchers a way to see data insights in a more visual format. Instead of just looking at numbers, the project provides plots and summaries that make it easier to understand the story behind the data.  

## Project Overview
The project takes maize and coffee marketing data and analyzes the values across different years. It includes cleaning the data, preparing it for analysis, and creating visualizations to compare the two crops. The analysis highlights trends, patterns, and differences between maize and coffee in terms of their marketed value.  

At the end of the project, there are conclusions and recommendations based on the findings. These insights can be useful for decision-making in farming, cooperative management, or agricultural studies.
